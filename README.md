### Tsuga
#### An early stage machine-learning library in Rust

Tsuga is an early stage machine learning library in Rust. It uses `ndarray` as the linear algebra backend, and operates primarily on two-dimensional `f32` arrays (`Array2<f32>` types). At the moment, it's primary function has been for testing out various ideas for APIs and as an educational exercise for understanding the structure and process of multi-layer convolutional neural networks and isn't suitable for serious use.

On a one-layer neural network with an application of the canny algorithm for image pre-processing, `tsuga` achieves 86% accuracy on the MNIST data set after 500 training iterations, and 87.7% after 5,000 iterations. This example can be run using:
```
$ cargo run --release --example mnist
```
To use `tsuga` as a library, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```
[dependencies]
tsuga = {git = "https://github.com/quietlychris/tsuga.git", branch = "master"}
ndarray = "0.13"
```
As a reminder, `tsuga` is still early-stage, and is probably not ready for serious use. BLAS operations are also enabled, which may require some configuration on your system. This can undone in the `Cargo.toml` file. 

At this point, most of the project's focus is on the image-processing domain (particuarly well-suited to 2D arrays), although the tools  and layout should generally applicable to higher/lower-dimensional datasets as well.

Tsuga currently is primarily broken into five stages:

1. Data import and pre-processing to `Array2<f32>`
    - This is done on an individual basis, since the location and format of the data is typically project-specific
2. Data convolution
    - Input arrays use convolutional layers (see features below) to reduce the number of features of each training record
    - Takes one input and uses a user-defined set of convolutional layers to produce one output
3. Each record is flattened at added to a input 2D array of `n x m` dimensions, with a corresponding output array of dimension `n x o` where `o` represents the number of categories that the input record can be mapped to (one-hot encoding).
    - This step eliminates the spatial context of the data
4. The input array is iterated through a set of fully-connected layers, where the user can define the output size of each layer and the activation function, where gradient descent minimizes the difference between the ideal output array and the final output of the fully-connected network. After training is completed, the network returns a model of it's layers, with trained weights and activation functions.
5. The model is used to evaluate an input with the same `m` dimensionality. This can be a test set similar to the training set, to validate the model's ability to classify data other than the training set.

Tsuga's training model is based on fairly simple, easy to understand linear algebra that can be inspected during any stage of the training. A network of L layers has five primary sets of matrices: `a`, `b`, `w`, `z`, and `delta`.

```
# Forward pass, "路" is the matrix dot product and f(), f'() is an activation function and the derivative of that function respectively
input -> a[0]
z[1] = a[0]路W[0]
a[1] = f(z[1]) + b[1]
   ...
a[L] = f(z[L]) + b[L]

# Backwards pass, ^T indicates a matrix transpose, "*" is element-wise multiplication or the Hadamard product
delta[L] = (a[L] - output) * f'(z[L]) * learnrate
w[L-1] = w[L-1] - a[L-1]^T 路 delta[L]
   ...
w[0] = w[0] - a[0]^T 路 delta[1]
```

#### Fully-connected network example
Tsuga currently uses the [Builder](https://xaeroxe.github.io/init-struct-pattern/) pattern for constructing fully-connected networks. Since these are complex compound structure, the helps to make the layout of the network explicit and modular.

```rust
use tsuga::prelude::*;

fn main() {

    let input: Array2<f32> = array![
        [1., 2., 3., 4.],
        [4., 3., 2., 1.],
        [1., 2., 2.5, 4.]
    ];
    let output: Array2<f32> = array![
        [1.0, 0.0],
        [0.0, 1.0],
        [1.0, 0.0]
    ];

    let mut layers_cfg: Vec<FCLayer> = Vec::new();
    let relu_layer_0 = FCLayer::new("relu", 2);
    layers_cfg.push(relu_layer_0);
    let sigmoid_layer_1 = FCLayer::new("sigmoid", 2);
    layers_cfg.push(sigmoid_layer_1);

    let mut network = FullyConnectedNetwork::default(input.clone(), output.clone())
        .add_layers(layers_cfg)
        .iterations(10000)
        .learnrate(0.01)
        .bias_learnrate(0.01)
        .build();

    let model = network.train();
    // let model = network.sgd_train(10); // Batch SGD implementation isn't really working at the moment
    println!("Trained network is:\n{:#?}", network);

    let test_input: Array2<f32> = array![
        [4., 3., 3., 1.],
        [1., 2., 1., 4.]
    ];
    let test_output: Array2<f32> = array![
        [0.0, 1.0],
        [1.0, 0.0]
    ];
    let test_result = model.evaluate(test_input);
    println!("Test result:\n{:#?}",test_result);
    println!("Ideal test output:\n{:#?}",test_output);
}

```
